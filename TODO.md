#TODO

##Important
-   Private message handler
-   Tease light too strong

###Next steps
-   Do the guide on F-list profile
-   Give more tokens to lower tier fighters when matched against a higher

####Optional/Ideas
-   Hide stats if the fight is of another type?
-   More achievements
-   Rework Triggers so we can add more
-   Add admin commands
-   Add inventory/gallery to store belts/records/other?
-   Rename/add stages
-   Use constants everywhere.
-   Implement different kind of matches, and display them before starting the fight: (in order of priority)
    Tables
    Ladder/Cage

##Bugs
-   Not correctly displaying that X player is broken after 3 turns not being focused


#Done
